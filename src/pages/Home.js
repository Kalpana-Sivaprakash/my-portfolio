                  I'm a junior Web developer with good knowledge of front end techniques and passionate about creating interactive applications. From Non-IT background to code on a web page, I love the structure and order and I also stand for quality. I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing web apps. Also i like working in a team, would learn faster and much more.
